            <p>I am a person eager to learn new challenges.</p>
            <p>I like to work as a team on large projects.</p>
            <p>I am willing to learn new technologies to push my limits. </p>
            <p>I like to go out on the field, meditate and exercise.</p>
            <p>My favorite quote is from the movie "The Theory Of Everything" love and survival of <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOsMMutM8C0" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Stephen Hawkig</a></strong>: There should be no boundaries for human effort. No matter how hard life may seem to us, as long as there is life there is hope.</p>
